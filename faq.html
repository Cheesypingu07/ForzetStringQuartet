            <p id="answer6" class="answer">In the unfortunate event that any one member of the quartet is unable to perform at an event, we will fill their spot with a substitute from our trusted network of musicians. </p>

        <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer7')">
            <h3>What does the Forzet need on the day of the event?</h3>
            <p id="answer7" class="answer">We require approximately a 10’x10’ rectangle of level ground, four armless chairs, and adequate lighting. As our instruments are highly sensitive, we would need accommodations for inclement weather, direct sunlight, high winds (especially near the sea), and extreme heat or cold. </p>
